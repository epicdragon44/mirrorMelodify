            <h1>Why Melodify?</h1>
            <p>In a crisis such as COVID-19, it is vital that people take time to stray away from the dire situations displayed in the news and focus more on one’s mental health during a time of social isolation. Mental health is something important to be aware of especially during this time, as a study done by Julianne Holt-Lunstad, PhD, showed that lack of social connection increases the rate of premature mortality, and that rate is even higher in those with severe depressive or mood disorders. </p><p></p>
            <p>In order to combat depressive moods in the past by psychologists, one common solution has been music. In fact, as found by researchers in Stanford, music seems to have the “same effect on the brain as [depression] medication does” - proving the impactful effect it has in the context of mood and emotion - and serves as an “easy stress reduction tool” when in periods of “at least 45 minutes”. </p><p></p>
            <p>Not all music seems to have the same effect however, as what the music portrays can often affect mood in the listener. The University of Nevada narrowed down the most calming and relaxing sounds to sounds of rain and/or thunder mixed with 4 main genres: celtic music, Native American instrumentals, Indian yoga soundtracks and light jazz. </p><p></p>
            <p>In terms of which is best: there is none. ‘Relaxing’ music is based on what the listener likes, whether that is loud thunder with light jazz or Indian meditation instrumentals with light rain in the background. This application is a way to achieve the optimal combination fit for the listener in order for them to achieve relaxation and de-stress considering the present circumstances.</p><p></p>
